# Me, My Pet, And I


## Description

We wanted to help our users connect with shelter dogs waiting to be adopted. Our users are able to search for any dog breed and add their potential pet to their favorites. They will also be able to generate a list of 10 random pet names.

On this site we are using Bulma.io as our CSS Framework.

## Usage

To complete the project we followed our user story.

As a user...
I want like to..
So that...

1. As a user looking to adopt a rescue dog. I want to click a button and receive images of avaiable dogs in the shelter. So that I can find a new pet.
2. As a user browsing through dog images. I want to save my favorite dog to a list. So that I can reference the dog at another time.
3. As a user looking to adopt. I want to navigate to the favorites page and see all of my favorited dogs. So that I can add or remove dogs I do not wish to adopt.

4. As a user looking to adopt a dog. I want to be able to generate a list of names. So that I can name my future dog.
